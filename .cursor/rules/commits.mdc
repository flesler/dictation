# Rules
- Start with an Action Verb: Use verbs like "Add", "Refactor", "Fix", "Implement", "Update", "Delete"
- Be very specific: Describe just the main change or feature in no more than 15-20 words
- No blob after with the changes, always a single sentence
- Don't make it unnecessarily fancy, we don't need to impress anyone, we are smart and we know it
- Don't end with a period
- Don't explain why it's done, just what's done
- If the git changes include a "// DONTCOMMIT" comment, make the commit message "DONTCOMMIT"

# Examples

- Refactor Sentry error handling in GraphQL plugin to log only the first error per request
- Create fake Estimates for Cash Advance line items/invoices in dailyMerchant to simplify the math
- Remove George from the MFD org and as a superadmin
- Move "Subscription" to "Other" as a line item type classification
- In reconcilePayment, match negative children of given invoices too, process them right before their parent
- Trim the GQL error list to always have at most one
