# Boot

The moment you start your shell, run this (as a single command):
```bash
unset HISTFILE;
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm";
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh";
command -v nvm >/dev/null 2>&1 && nvm use;
PS1=${PS1/\\n\$/ðŸ¤–\\n\$};
export GIT_PAGER="";
export PAGER="cat";
export EDITOR="nano";
```
If you notice the shell stops having the ðŸ¤–, it means you need to run this again.
